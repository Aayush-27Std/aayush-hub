Ellipse Drawing Algorithm (Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm)

Objective

To draw an ellipse on a raster display efficiently using integer calculations and symmetry properties, minimizing computational cost.

Introduction

An ellipse is a closed curve defined as the set of points for which the sum of distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. In computer graphics, drawing an ellipse accurately and efficiently on a pixel-based display is important for rendering shapes such as circles, orbits, and design elements.

The Midpoint Ellipse Drawing Algorithm is an efficient rasterization technique that determines which pixels best approximate an ellipse using decision parameters.

Mathematical Representation

The standard equation of an ellipse centered at  is:

\frac{x^2}{r_x^2} + \frac{y^2}{r_y^2} = 1

where

 = radius along x-axis

 = radius along y-axis

Principle of the Algorithm

The algorithm divides the ellipse into two regions based on slope:

1. Region 1:
Slope magnitude < 1
Movement is primarily in the x-direction


2. Region 2:
Slope magnitude ≥ 1
Movement is primarily in the y-direction



At each step, a decision parameter determines whether the next pixel is chosen horizontally or diagonally.

Symmetry Property

An ellipse is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis.
Using this symmetry, only one quadrant is computed, and the remaining points are obtained by reflection:

(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (-x, -y)

This reduces computation significantly.

Step 2: Initialization (Region 1)

Start point:

Step 4: Initialization (Region 2)

Decision parameter:

p_2 = r_y^2(x+0.5)^2 + r_x^2(y-1)^2 - r_x^2 r_y^2
