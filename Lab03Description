## Midpoint Circle Generation Algorithm (Theory)

The **Midpoint Circle Generation Algorithm** is a **raster graphics algorithm** used in computer graphics to draw a circle efficiently on a pixel-based display. It is widely used because it relies only on **integer arithmetic**, making it fast and accurate.


## 1. Basic Idea

A circle with center **(0, 0)** and radius **r** is mathematically defined as:

[
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
]

Instead of calculating every point using floating-point math, the midpoint algorithm **decides which pixel is closer to the true circle** at each step by evaluating a **decision parameter**.


## 2. Symmetry of a Circle

A circle is symmetric in **8 octants**.
So, if we calculate points in **one octant**, the remaining points can be obtained by reflection.

For a point ((x, y)), the other symmetric points are:

* ((x, y)), ((y, x))
* ((-x, y)), ((-y, x))
* ((x, -y)), ((y, -x))
* ((-x, -y)), ((-y, -x))

This reduces computation by **8 times**.


## 3. Starting Point

The algorithm starts at:
[
(x_0, y_0) = (0, r)
]

We move from the **top of the circle toward the right**, calculating points until:
[
x \leq y
]


## 4. Decision Parameter

To decide whether the next pixel should be:

* **East (E):** ((x+1, y))
  or
* **South-East (SE):** ((x+1, y-1))

we evaluate the midpoint between these two pixels.

### Initial Decision Parameter:

[
p_0 = 1 - r
]


## 5. Decision Rules

### Case 1: If (p_k < 0)

* Midpoint is **inside** the circle
* Choose **East (E)**
* Update:
  [
  p_{k+1} = p_k + 2x + 3
  ]

### Case 2: If (p_k \geq 0)

* Midpoint is **outside** the circle
* Choose **South-East (SE)**
* Update:
  [
  p_{k+1} = p_k + 2x - 2y + 5
  ]
* Decrease (y) by 1

In both cases:
[
x = x + 1
]


## 6. Algorithm Steps (Summary)

1. Input radius **r** and center ((x_c, y_c))
2. Initialize:

   * (x = 0), (y = r)
   * (p = 1 - r)
3. Plot the 8 symmetric points
4. Repeat while (x \leq y):

   * Update (x)
   * Update (p) using decision rules
   * Update (y) if needed
   * Plot symmetric points
5. Stop when (x > y)


## 7. Advantages

* Uses **only integer arithmetic**
* Faster than trigonometric methods
* High accuracy
* Ideal for real-time graphics and hardware implementation


## 8. Applications

* Drawing circles in **computer graphics**
* GUI components (buttons, icons)
* Games and simulations
* Embedded and low-level graphics systems
