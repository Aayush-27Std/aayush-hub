## Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm – Theory

**Bresenham’s algorithm** is an efficient raster graphics algorithm used to draw a straight line between two points on a pixel-based display (such as a computer screen). It determines which pixel should be plotted next so that the line appears as close as possible to a true straight line.

### 1. Why Bresenham’s Algorithm is Needed

* A mathematical line is continuous, but a computer screen is made of **discrete pixels**.
* Simply using the line equation ( y = mx + c ) involves **floating-point calculations**, which are slow and inefficient.
* Bresenham’s algorithm uses **only integer arithmetic**, making it **fast and accurate**.

---

### 2. Basic Idea

The algorithm works by:

* Starting from one endpoint of the line
* Moving pixel by pixel in the **x-direction** (or y-direction for steep lines)
* At each step, choosing between **two possible pixels**:

  * One directly to the right
  * One diagonally to the right and up (or down)

The choice is made using a **decision parameter** that measures how far the current pixel is from the ideal line.

### 3. Assumptions (for basic explanation)

* Line is drawn from left to right
* Slope ( m ) lies between **0 and 1**
* Start point: ( (x_0, y_0) )
* End point: ( (x_1, y_1) )

Let:

* ( dx = x_1 - x_0 )
* ( dy = y_1 - y_0 )

### 4. Decision Parameter

A **decision parameter ( p )** is used to decide which pixel to plot next.

Initial decision parameter:
[
p_0 = 2dy - dx
]

At each step:

* If ( p < 0 ):
  Choose pixel **E** (East) → ( (x+1, y) )
* If ( p \ge 0 ):
  Choose pixel **NE** (North-East) → ( (x+1, y+1) )

Update rules:

* If E is chosen:
  [
  p_{k+1} = p_k + 2dy
  ]
* If NE is chosen:
  [
  p_{k+1} = p_k + 2(dy - dx)
  ]

### 5. Working Principle (Step-by-Step)

1. Calculate ( dx ), ( dy )
2. Initialize decision parameter ( p_0 )
3. Plot the starting pixel
4. For each ( x ) from ( x_0 ) to ( x_1 ):

   * Check decision parameter
   * Select the appropriate pixel
   * Update the decision parameter
5. Continue until the end point is reached

### 6. Advantages

* Uses **only integer calculations**
* **Fast** and efficient
* Produces smooth and accurate lines
* Widely used in **computer graphics hardware**

---

### 7. Limitations

* Original form works best when slope is between 0 and 1
* Needs modification for:

  * Steep lines (( m > 1 ))
  * Negative slopes
  * Different octants

---

### 8. Applications

* Line drawing in **computer graphics**
* CAD systems
* Game development
* GUI rendering
* Raster display systems

### 9. Conclusion

Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm is a cornerstone of computer graphics. By replacing floating-point math with integer decision parameters, it efficiently determines the best pixel positions to approximate a straight line on a raster display.
